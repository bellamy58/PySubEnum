**PySubEnum** is a robust, multi-threaded **Subdomain Enumeration & Reconnaissance Tool**. It combines passive source gathering with active resolution and port scanning capabilities to provide a comprehensive view of the target's attack surface.

## 🚀 Features

* **🔍 Multi-Source Passive Recon:** Aggregates data from **Crt.sh**, **HackerTarget**, and **AlienVault OTX**.
* **🌐 Active DNS Resolution:** Filters dead subdomains by resolving IP addresses (A Records).
* **⚓ Port Scanning:** Optionally scans top critical ports (21, 22, 80, 443, 3306, etc.) on discovered assets.
* **⚡ High Performance:** Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent scanning.
* **📂 Smart Reporting:** Exports results (Domain, IP, Ports) to a file.
